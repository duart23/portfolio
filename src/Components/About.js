          I am a very active person and I enjoy a lot of different sports and
          activities, especially if I can do them with my friends. Also, I am
          very sociable in all sorts of environments.

          I am a dedicated software engineering student currently pursuing my
          clear goal of becoming a full-fledged engineer. I have a special
          interest in technology and problem-solving.
